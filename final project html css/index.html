                <p class="about_me">My name is Petya Mihaylova and I am a Cloud Solutions Architect with agile and project-management skills, as well as knowledge and multiple certifications in Cloud Security, DevOps and Networking, both in Azure, AWS and Google. I have both a technical (over 5 years of experience) and customer-facing background (over 8 years of experience). 
                    I strive to constantly learn and develop, as well as deliver excellence in my day-to-day activities at work and beyond. I believe that professional success is something to be achieved both on an individual level and within the team, while helping one another be the best versions of ourselves. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, watching martial arts movies and working out.</p>

                <figure><img src="form_picture.png" alt="Picture of a registration form" class="form_picture"/></figure></a><dd>This sample registration form is my very first project in HTML/CSS. There is simple input validation (e.g., in the case of email) and input suggestions to help the user orient themselves as to the type of data to input. The registration button opens to a new page with the help of the "_blank"-parameter, however, it is not made active yet. This is a work in progress.

        <li class="table">

            <figure><img src="table_picture.png" alt="Picture of a table" class="table_picture"/></figure></a> The project showcases the functuionality of an HTML/CSS table, representing the top 10 billionaires of 2024 until now. The first 3 entries are bolded and each line lights up in a different color on hover.

            <a href="https://github.com/PetyaMihaylova/Masonry_Grid_Task_Petya/blob/master/Masonry_Grid_Task_Petya.html" target="_blank">Masonry Gallery
            <figure><img src="masonry_gallery_picture.png" alt="Picture of a masonry gallery" class="masonry_gallery_picture"/></figure></a>This masonry gallery is my favorite project thus far, because of the vivacity of images and colors. It represents a collage of images within a grid box. The text on top has been resolved with the help of z-index. Images have been selected based on their composition qualities, as well as their orientation (landscape vs. portrait.) Improvements to follow.
